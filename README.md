# Fights-Simulator
I came up with the idea of this game during one sleepless night. Then I created the initial version of the game- simply creating some logic of the game and some primary processes that happen withing the course of the game. Then i decided that I should continue working on the game in my free time and improve it. For this I thought that it will be best if I transfer from the initial language Java to C# simply because I have much more  experience (and knowledge too) and I'm more used to the language.
